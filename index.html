		<strong>INGREDIENTS</strong>
		<br>
		<br>
		<i>Chicken</i>
		<br>
		1 lb / 500g chicken thigh fillets (skinless and boneless)
		<br>
		1/2 tbsp kecap manis (thick sweet soy sauce)
		<br>
		1 tbsp unsalted butter, melted
		<br>
		12 - 14 small bamboo skewers, soaked in water for at least 30 minutes
		<br>
		<br>
		<i>Peanut Sauce</i>
		<br>
		1 tbsp cooking oil (peanut, canola, vegetable)
		<br>
		2 garlic cloves, minced
		<br>
		1 small or 1/2 large onion, diced (red, brown, yellow or white)
		<br>
		3 birds eye chillis, sliced (or sub with hot sauce)
		<br>
		1/2 cup peanut butter (smooth or crunchy)
		<br>
		1 cup coconut milk (full fat is better, but light is ok)
		<br>
		2 1/2 tbsp kecap manis
		<br>
		1/2 tbsp soy sauce
		<br>
		1/2 tsp salt
		<br>
		1/4 cup crushed unsalted roasted peanuts
		<br>
		1 - 2 tbsp fresh lime juice
		<br>
		<br>
		<i>Garnish (Optional)</i>
		<br>
		Crushed peanuts
		<br>
		Lime wedges
		<br>
		Sliced shallots/scallions
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<strong>INSTRUCTIONS</strong>
		<br>
		<br>
		<i>Chicken</i>
		<br>
		1. Cut the chicken into 1.5cm/0.5‚Äù cubes. Thread onto skewers - 
		4 to 5 pieces per skewer.
		<br>
		2. Combine kecap manis and butter, then brush onto chicken.
		<br>
		3. Cook the skewers on a hot BBQ (outdoor grill) or on the stove in a large non stick fry pan (add a splash of oil, and make sure the skewers will fit in the pan). Grill/broiler would also work.
		<br>
		4. Serve, garnished with crushed peanuts, shallots and with lime wedges and Peanut Sauce on the side.
		<br>
		<br>
		<i>Peanut Sauce</i>
		<br>
		1. Heat oil in a small saucepan over medium high heat. Add garlic, onion and chillis and cook for 3 minutes until onion is translucent.
		<br>
		2. Turn heat down to medium, then add peanut butter, coconut milk, kecap manis, soy sauce and salt. Simmer for 10 minutes, whisking occasionally.
		<br>
		3. Use a handheld stick to puree (so the onion and chilli blends throughout the sauce - this is key). Stir through crushed peanuts and lime juice and simmer for 2 minutes. Allow to cool slightly before serving or to room temperature - it will thicken.
